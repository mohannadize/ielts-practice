|Band|Task response|Coherence and cohesion|Lexical resource|Grammatical range and accuracy|
|9|• fully addresses all parts of the task • presents a fully developed position in answer to the question with relevant| fully extended and well supported ideas|• uses cohesion in such a way that it attracts no attention • skilfully manages paragraphing|• uses a wide range of vocabulary with very natural and sophisticated control of lexical features; rare minor errors occur only as ‘slips’|• uses a wide range of structures with full flexibility and accuracy; rare minor errors occur only as ‘slips’|
|8|• sufficiently addresses all parts of the task • presents a well-developed response to the question with relevant| extended and supported ideas|• sequences information and ideas logically • manages all aspects of cohesion well • uses paragraphing sufficiently and appropriately|• uses a wide range of vocabulary fluently and flexibly to convey precise meanings • skilfully uses uncommon lexical items but there may be occasional inaccuracies in word choice and collocation • produces rare errors in spelling and/or word formation|• uses a wide range of structures • the majority of sentences are error-free • makes only very occasional errors or inappropriacies|
|7|• addresses all parts of the task • presents a clear position throughout the response • presents| extends and supports main ideas| but there may be a tendency to over-generalise and/or supporting ideas may lack focus|• logically organises information and ideas; there is clear progression throughout • uses a range of cohesive devices appropriately although there may be some under-/over-use • presents a clear central topic within each paragraph|• uses a sufficient range of vocabulary to allow some flexibility and precision • uses less common lexical items with some awareness of style and collocation • may produce occasional errors in word choice| spelling and/or word formation|• uses a variety of complex structures • produces frequent error-free sentences • has good control of grammar and punctuation but may make a few errors|
|6|• addresses all parts of the task although some parts may be more fully covered than others • presents a relevant position although the conclusions may become unclear or repetitive • presents relevant main ideas but some may be inadequately developed/unclear|• arranges information and ideas coherently and there is a clear overall progression • uses cohesive devices effectively| but cohesion within and/or between sentences may be faulty or mechanical • may not always use referencing clearly or appropriately • uses paragraphing| but not always logically|• uses an adequate range of vocabulary for the task • attempts to use less common vocabulary but with some inaccuracy • makes some errors in spelling and/or word formation| but they do not impede communication|• uses a mix of simple and complex sentence forms • makes some errors in grammar and punctuation but they rarely reduce communication|
|5|• addresses the task only partially; the format may be inappropriate in places • expresses a position but the development is not always clear and there may be no conclusions drawn • presents some main ideas but these are limited and not sufficiently developed; there may be irrelevant detail|• presents information with some organisation but there may be a lack of overall progression • makes inadequate| inaccurate or over-use of cohesive devices • may be repetitive because of lack of referencing and substitution • may not write in paragraphs| or paragraphing may be inadequate|• uses a limited range of vocabulary| but this is minimally adequate for the task • may make noticeable errors in spelling and/or word formation that may cause some difficulty for the reader|• uses only a limited range of structures • attempts complex sentences but these tend to be less accurate than simple sentences • may make frequent grammatical errors and punctuation may be faulty; errors can cause some difficulty for the reader|
|4|• responds to the task only in a minimal way or the answer is tangential; the format may be inappropriate • presents a position but this is unclear • presents some main ideas but these are difficult to identify and may be repetitive| irrelevant or not well supported|• presents information and ideas but these are not arranged coherently and there is no clear progression in the response • uses some basic cohesive devices but these may be inaccurate or repetitive • may not write in paragraphs or their use may be confusing|• uses only basic vocabulary which may be used repetitively or which may be inappropriate for the task • has limited control of word formation and/or spelling; errors may cause strain for the reader|• uses only a very limited range of structures with only rare use of subordinate clauses • some structures are accurate but errors predominate| and punctuation is often faulty|
|3|• does not adequately address any part of the task • does not express a clear position • presents few ideas| which are largely undeveloped or irrelevant|• does not organise ideas logically • may use a very limited range of cohesive devices| and those used may not indicate a logical relationship between ideas|• uses only a very limited range of words and expressions with very limited control of word formation and/or spelling • errors may severely distort the message|• attempts sentence forms but errors in grammar and punctuation predominate and distort the meaning|
|2|• barely responds to the task • does not express a position • may attempt to present one or two ideas but there is no development|• has very little control of organisational features|• uses an extremely limited range of vocabulary; essentially no control of word formation and/or spelling|• cannot use sentence forms except in memorised phrases|
|1|• answer is completely unrelated to the task|• fails to communicate any message|• can only use a few isolated words|• cannot use sentence forms at all|
|0|• does not attend • does not attempt the task in any way • writes a totally memorised response||||
